# Username Removal from Leaderboard

We respect users' privacy and understand that some may not wish to have their GitHub activity tracked in our Contribution Tracking App. If you would like to have your username removed from the leaderboard and prevent any future tracking, please follow the steps outlined below.

## How to Request Removal and Blocking

1. **Submit a Removal Request**: Open a new issue in this repository with the title **"Username Removal Request"**.

2. **Provide Required Information**:
   - **Your GitHub Username**: Include your exact GitHub username in the request.
   - **Removal Statement**: Add a brief statement requesting removal from the leaderboard and blocking of future tracking.
   
   **Example**:
   ```
   Title: Username Removal Request
   Body:
   - Username: [Your GitHub Username]
   - Statement: I would like to request removal from the leaderboard and blocking of future tracking.
   ```

3. **Confirmation and Processing**: Once we receive your request, we will process the removal within 7 business days. After confirmation, your username will no longer appear on the leaderboard, and all tracking for your username will be permanently disabled.

4. **Important Note**: This action is **permanent**. Once your username is blocked, it cannot be re-added to the leaderboard or tracked again in the future.

## Privacy and Data Handling

Your privacy is important to us. Upon processing your request, all associated data for your username will be permanently deleted from our system and will not be recoverable.

If you have any questions about this process, please feel free to open an issue with the label `question`.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!
