# CommitKing

Welcome to the CommitKing! ðŸŽ‰

This app tracks the number of consecutive days a GitHub user has been actively contributing, including commits, pull requests, issues, and more. Whether you're coding, reviewing, or reporting issues, weâ€™re here to celebrate your contributions!

## Features

- **Leaderboard**: See how long you've been on a contribution streak.
- **Track Contributions**: GitHub activities like commits, pull requests, and issues.
- **Excludes Bots**: Only real human activity counts. Bots and automated accounts are excluded from the leaderboard.

## How to Use

1. **Login with your GitHub account**.
2. Your contributions will automatically be tracked.
3. Check the leaderboard to see how you're doing and compare with others!

## Rules

- Bot accounts won't be allowed on the leaderboard.
- Only meaningful contributions (commits, pull requests, issues, etc.) count toward the streak.
- If you'd like to remove your username or report suspicious activity, check out the [Username Removal](removal_request.md) and [Bot Reporting](report_bot_account.md) guidelines.

## Want to Help?

If you notice any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or contribute via pull requests. Your feedback is always welcome!
