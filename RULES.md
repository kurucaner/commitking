# Contribution Tracking App - Rules

Welcome to the Contribution Tracking App! This app tracks the number of consecutive days a GitHub user has been actively contributing through commits, pull requests, issues, and more. To ensure fair and accurate tracking, please follow the rules outlined below.

## Rules

* **No Bot Accounts**: Bot accounts are not allowed in the Leaderboard. This includes any accounts with "bot" in their username or accounts flagged as automated.
* **Definition of Active Contribution**: Contributions include commits, pull requests, issue creation, and code reviews. Each day of activity must include at least one substantial action to count as a "contribution day."
* **No Fork-Only Contributions**: Contributions made solely on forked repositories without merging back to the main repository will not count towards streaks.
* **No Low-Quality Contributions**: Trivial, repetitive actions meant to artificially boost rankings (e.g., multiple small commits for no substantial purpose) are discouraged and may be excluded from the streak count.
* **Periodic Rule Review**: Rules may be updated periodically to adapt to GitHubâ€™s evolving contribution features and to maintain fairness.

Thank you for contributing to the open-source community and for being part of the Contribution Tracking App! If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue in this repository.
