# Reporting Bot Accounts

To maintain a fair and accurate leaderboard, we encourage users to report any bot accounts or suspicious activity. If you believe an account is falsely listed as a contributor or if automated activity is inflating a user’s streak, please follow the steps below to submit a report.

## How to Report a Bot Account

1. **Submit a Report**: Open a new issue in this repository with the title **"Bot Account Report"**.

2. **Provide Required Information**:
   - **Username of the Suspected Bot**: Include the GitHub username of the account you believe is a bot or engaging in automated activity.
   - **Reason for Report**: Briefly explain why you suspect this account is a bot. For example, if you notice repetitive, automated, or low-quality contributions, please describe them.
   - **Evidence (if applicable)**: If you have any additional information or evidence that can help verify the report (e.g., links to the user’s activity), please include it.

   **Example**:
   ```
   Title: Bot Account Report
   Body:
   - Username: [Suspected Bot Username]
   - Reason: [Reason for Report]
   - Evidence: [Links or other relevant information]
   ```

3. **Review Process**: Our team will review your report within 7 business days. If we determine that the account is indeed a bot or engaging in automated behavior, it will be removed from the leaderboard.

4. **Confidentiality**: Your report will be handled confidentially, and your identity will not be disclosed to the reported user.
